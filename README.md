# Dough Rise Detector ‚Äì IR Sensor with Raspberry Pi Pico WH

**Author**: Olof Gilland / og222ig

In this project, I created an IoT dough-rise detection system using a Raspberry Pi Pico WH and an IR break beam sensor. The system uses LEDs to visually indicate dough rising and has been tested for future expansion with AWS email alerts. The idea was inspired by the baking process where monitoring dough manually is common. This solution brings a touch of automation to the kitchen.

The project is estimated to take **4‚Äì8 hours**, depending on experience.

## üéØ Objective

I wanted to automate the process of tracking dough rise while baking pizza. By placing dough in a clear plastic rain gauge, I could use a non-contact IR beam sensor to detect when the dough had doubled in size and blocked the beam. This lets me:

- Avoid constant visual checking.
- Collect time-based insights for improving rise predictions.
- (Future) Track impact of temperature/humidity using additional sensors.
- (Future) Send notifications to email or smartphone.

## üíª Computer Setup

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  
- **Extensions**: Pymakr for uploading code to the Pico  
- **Firmware**: [MicroPython for Pico W](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/)  
- **Tools Installed**:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - Pymakr extension in VS Code
- **Workflow**:
  1. Flash MicroPython firmware to Pico WH via drag-and-drop mode.
  2. Write code in `main.py` and upload via Pymakr.
  3. Debug over USB serial.

## üîå Putting Everything Together

A simplified description of the wiring:

- IR Transmitter:  
  - VCC to 3.3V rail  
  - GND to GND rail

- IR Receiver:  
  - OUT to GP19  
  - 10kŒ© resistor between OUT and GND (pull-down)

- Green LED:  
  - Anode to GP14 via 330Œ© resistor  
  - Cathode to GND rail

- Red LED:  
  - Anode to GP15 via 330Œ© resistor  
  - Cathode to GND rail

**Voltage**: 3.3V  
**Resistor Calc**: LEDs use ~20mA; 330Œ© limits current to ~10mA which is safe for GPIO.

A full circuit diagram was sketched by hand (image to be included in report or appendix).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Platform

Currently running fully **offline** on a Raspberry Pi Pico WH with no cloud or server. The only planned extension is to use **AWS SES** + **Lambda** to send an email when dough has risen.  

Platform choice:
- **Local** to reduce complexity.
- **Pico WH** chosen for built-in Wi-Fi, affordable price, and strong MicroPython support.

For scaling:
- Add cloud services (AWS, Azure IoT)
- Add temperature/humidity sensors
- Use InfluxDB + Grafana for tracking rise data over time

## üß† The Code

```python
from machine import Pin
import time

sensor = Pin(19, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
led_green = Pin(14, Pin.OUT)
led_red = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)

while True:
    if sensor.value() == 1:
        print("Beam FREE ‚Äì Dough not risen")
        led_green.on()
        led_red.off()
    else:
        print("Beam BLOCKED ‚Äì Dough has risen!")
        led_green.off()
        led_red.on()
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

Uploaded via Pymakr to the Raspberry Pi Pico WH.

## üì° Transmitting Data (Future)

Currently no data is transmitted.

**Planned**:
- Wi-Fi connection with AWS SES + Lambda
- Email sent only when dough has risen (red LED on)
- Throttled: only 1 email every 1‚Äì2 minutes using DynamoDB timestamp check

**Protocols**:
- Wi-Fi for network
- AWS SDK (Boto3 in Lambda) for sending email
- No MQTT or webhook in this version

---

## üìä Presenting the Data

No visual dashboard in this version.

**Planned ideas**:
- Use OLED screen to show status
- Log timestamps to cloud and graph in Grafana
- Store events in DynamoDB or InfluxDB

---

## ‚úÖ Final Design

The system consists of:

- Rain gauge to hold dough  
- IR sensor on the side  
- Breadboard with Pico WH and LEDs  
- USB for power and debugging  
- Fully working indicator LEDs

**Lessons learned**:
- IR beam sensors work through plastic!
- Need controlled lighting to avoid interference
- Could be made portable with battery and case
